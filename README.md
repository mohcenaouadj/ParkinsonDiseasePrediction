# Parkinson Disease Prediction

Traditional diagnosis of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease involves a clinician taking a neurological history of the patient and observing motor skills in various situations. Since PD patients exhibit characteristic vocal features, voice recordings are a useful and non-invasive tool for diagnosis. The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning algorithms in order to predict the possibly of diagnose PD.

My proposed model introduced different data preprocessing methods, such as ; 
- Data standardization, multicollinearity diagnosis, dimensionality reduction technique to improve the quality of data.

Different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers were used for classification of PD :
- k-nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression

- Hyperparameter tuning, cross fold validation and grid search were employed in this experiment to maximize the performance of the classifiers and preserve the class distribution of the imbalanced data-set.

My proposed model achieved the highest accuracy of 94.10% which outperformed the previous experiments on the same data-set by roughly 8.00%.
